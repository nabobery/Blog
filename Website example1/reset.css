/* Reset CSS is the process of resetting (or more accurately – setting) the styles of all elements to a baseline value so that you
avoid cross-browser differences due to their built-in default style settings. By resetting your styles, you avoid defaulting to the
browser’s built-in styles, which differs from browser to browser.
